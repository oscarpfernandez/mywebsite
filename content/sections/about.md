This blog was created by Oscar Fernandez - Software Engineer and a mix of Spanish and Portuguese roots. 

This page only aspires to serve as a writing canvas for whatever thoughts are occupying my mind. No more than that.

But don't worry, only "good vibes" are going to be allowed to exist here, alongside with some occasional technical 
rants - please bare with me, we have all been there. :) 

The articles in this website reflect only my personal views. Opinions are my own, and none from my current or former 
employers.

Thanks for reading!
