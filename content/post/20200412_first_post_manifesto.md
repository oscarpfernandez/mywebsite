# Why another blog?

The last few years I've been entertaining the idea of having a blog. A sort of personal writing canvas to draft some 
thoughts and throw them into, without any pretentious goals. In the best case, to help other people and exchange ideas, 
and at the very least to help myself - by having a log that I can look back and assess how my views evolved over time.

During all these years as a developer a huge number of technical blogs that definitely have helped me to learn and 
evolve. At this point, I'd just like to give back, and through this humble format, I hope that some ideas posted could 
help others.

# What kind of topics?

Well, that's a tricky question. Potentially about anything that sparks my interest and curiosity! Without any barriers
or preconceived ideas. All ideas are valid under the light of critical discussion as long there is an positive insight 
or outcome that can be drawn out of it.

As a software engineer, I've worked over the years on a broad set of problems and technologies: machine learning; mobile
technologies, computer vision, and general software development in Java, C++ and more recently in Golang. 

Although I might go back and write about some fields that I've worked previously, I'll focus in the wonderful 
[Golang](https://go.dev/).
Yes, Golang! Despite its simplicity, it has influenced my coding style, more than any other language, not to mention the 
plethora of other cool technologies that often sidecar with it, that I might talk about here as well.

Of course I might also digress and talk about other topics. As a kid that grew up in the 90's, some of my spare time was 
occupied playing games like 
[Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), 
[Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)), 
and others. Given that most of these games had their engines released as Open Source (thank you 
[John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack)!) there is a 
[thriving mod community](https://www.moddb.com/games/doom/mods) around them. 
So there's a lot to be said about that too.

So, as you can infer by the title of this blog, I enjoy understanding the amazing possibilities that these little 
computing Machines - working at astounding speeds - allow us to achieve. 

Last, but not least I enjoy reading - a lot - so, here and there I might write about some of the books I'm spending time
with. Don't expect any literary deep dive or anything of the sorts, just the friendly "word of mouth" that I like a 
certain book for whatever reason.

That's all for now, and Thanks for reading!
